We started on Rails, covering setting up a new project with a README, rvm and running `rails new`: https://github.com/elizabrock/NSS-basic-rails-blog

We also set up global .gitignore files:
* https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files
* http://devoh.com/blog/2013/01/global-gitignore

And made sure the students were able to see hidden files in their file browsers. For Finder:

And we discussed open source licensing:
* http://opensource.org/licenses

The afternoon assignment was to set up Travis for the student's Ruby Capstone projects.

The instructions were:

1. Sign up for Travis
2. Turn on Travis for your repo
3. Add travis.yml to your project
4. Push your project to Github
5. Add a Travis badge to your README

The travis.yml in my NSS-futureperfect-CLI project is a good template.
