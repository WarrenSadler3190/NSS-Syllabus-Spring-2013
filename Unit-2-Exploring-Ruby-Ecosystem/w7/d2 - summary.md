We did book club on section 2 of the Pragmatic Programmer and then spent much of class working on individual capstone projects.

Also, a great big bucket of reading material:

* [Fundamentals of SQL from Jumpstart Labs](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/fundamental_sql.html)
* [Ruby Rogues discussing RubyGems and how to make your own!](http://rubyrogues.com/103-rr-ruby-gems/?utm_source=rubyweekly&utm_medium=email)
* [Lea Verou: Demystifying Regular Expressions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkluES9Rvak)
* [A nice overview of being a responsible programmer](http://anders.janmyr.com/2013/04/a-responsible-programmer.html?utm_source=statuscode&utm_medium=email)
* [A primer on the mathematics of programming](http://jeremykun.com/primers/) (This includes a nice look at Big-O)
* [Learnable Programming](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/)
* [An excellent explanation of why to always TDD | The Startup Trap](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2013/03/05/TheStartUpTrap.html)
* [/r/readablecode](http://www.reddit.com/r/readablecode) with an [example discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/readablecode/comments/1c77b9/fairly_new_programmer_here_why_do_people_care/)
* [An interesting exposition on "Signs that you're a bad programmer"](https://sites.google.com/site/yacoset/Home/signs-that-you-re-a-bad-programmer) Don't take the "Signs that you shouldn't be a programmer" section seriously though.  That doesn't apply until after the class is over.


The pinnacle of this list of links:

* [The Magic Tricks of Testing, by Sandi Metz](https://speakerdeck.com/skmetz/magic-tricks-of-testing-railsconf?slide=0)
* [Uncle Bob explains The Pragmatics of TDD](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2013/03/06/ThePragmaticsOfTDD.html)

(Sandi and Bob are extremely well respected in the field.)
