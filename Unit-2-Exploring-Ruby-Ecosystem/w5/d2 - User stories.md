Today's assignment:

  1. Write a README for your project
  2. Commit your list of user stories to your project in the doc directory (e.g. doc/user_stories.md)

The user stories should look like:

  >  As a [user or actor]

  >  In order to [accomplish goal X or achieve a given business value]

  >  I want to [perform an action]
