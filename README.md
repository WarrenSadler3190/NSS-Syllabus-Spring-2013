## Course Goals and Expected Outcomes

### Starting Point:
25 students with a wide variety of experiences and education levels. 

Our students currently have some skills with HTML/CSS/Javascript and have, to some extent, been exposed to client work and wordpress/php.

Rumour has it that this class has knowledge of git and unix as well.

The students have a strong focus on the end-result of being professional software developers.

### Goal:

To produce hirable Junior Developers.  As such, they should be able to:

  * build on existing Rails applications
  * work on cross-disciplinary teams
  * grow their skills independently
  * understand the depth and breadth of the field
