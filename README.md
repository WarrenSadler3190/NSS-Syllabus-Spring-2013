## Course Goals and Expected Outcomes

### Starting Point:
25 students with a wide variety of experiences and education levels. 

Our students currently have some skills with HTML/CSS/Javascript and have, to some extent, been exposed to client work and wordpress/php.

Rumour has it that this class has knowledge of git and unix as well.

The students have a strong focus on the end-result of being professional software developers.

### Goal:

To produce hirable Junior Developers.  As such, they should be able to:

  * build on existing Rails applications
  * work on cross-disciplinary teams
  * grow their skills independently
  * understand the depth and breadth of the field

## Instructors

[Eliza Brock](http://elizabrock.com/), owner of [Eliza Brock Software](http://elizabrocksoftware.com/).  Eliza has written web applications that span from boutique e-commerce sites to web services that support hundreds of thousands of mobile devices.  She is returning to teach Software Development Fundamentals for a second time.

### Assistant Instructor

  * Week 7: Working on capstone projects; MVC, HTTP, REPLs (May 20-26)
  * Week 8: Capstone project presentations; REST; Spinning up and deploying a simple Rails app (May 27-June 2)

### 4. Advanced Topics and Career Prep.

**Goal**: Students form an understanding of the depth and breadth of the field while meeting many of the practicing developers in Nashville.

**Capstone**: Develop a decent-sized resume-worthy Rails app using TDD
